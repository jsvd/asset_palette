## Notes

### Sprite Sheet Detection Approach
1. Download pack
2. Inspect sprite sheets (dimensions, consistent grid?)
3. Map sprite names to coordinates
4. Document animations (frame sequences, FPS)
5. Add semantic tags

### Common Grid Sizes
- 8×8 - Pico-8 style, micro roguelikes
- 16×16 - Tiny series, classic pixel art
- 24×24 - Medium pixel art
- 32×32 - Standard pixel art
- 64×64 - HD pixel art
- Variable - Vector packs (individual PNGs)

### Automation Opportunities
- Auto-detect grid from image dimensions
- Parse existing JSON/XML metadata (some packs include it)
- Generate definitions from consistent naming patterns
